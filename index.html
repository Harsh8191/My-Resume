        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Being a kid who grew up disassembling computers just to understand how the parts fit together, my path towards coding was a natural progression.<br /> My journey began with a small project; I created a simple website for my local library when I was in high school. The joy of seeing my code come to life, enhancing utility and ease-of-use for people, was immeasurable.
            I pursued my passion in college, majoring in Computer Science. My sophomore year, I landed an internship with InternshipStudio, a fast-growing tech firm. This was a transformative experience.
             After graduation, I am looking to join a creative and innovative software solutions company.<br />
            Outside of work, I'm an ardent lover of outdoor adventures and Cricket The complexity of trails, the need to adapt with changes in weather conditions, remarkably parallels with the versatility and adaptability required in full stack development. Conquering a new trail or successfully troubleshooting a complex piece of code, both bring me a profound sense of accomplishment.<br />
            In case you're looking for someone who is as passionate about navigating code as he is about navigating balls, feel free to reach me via email at <a href="mailto:hs78102@gmail.com">hs78102gmail.com</a>.<br /> 
            I'm always open to discussing potential projects, brainstorming innovative tech solutions.<br />
